Thermodynamics


Special Cases of Steady-Flow Energy Equation
Nozzles, Diffusers: Velocity terms are significant. No elevation change, no heat transfer, and no work. Single-mass stream.
         hi + Vi2/2 = he + Ve2/2
                                          Ve2 - Vi2
Isentropic Efficiency (nozzle) =
                                         2 `hi - hes j
where hes = enthalpy at isentropic exit state.

Turbines, Pumps, Compressors: Often considered adiabatic (no heat transfer). Velocity terms usually can be ignored. There are
significant work terms and a single-mass stream.
         hi = he + w
                                          hi - he
Isentropic Efficiency (turbine) =
                                          hi - hes
                                                         hes - hi
Isentropic Efficiency (compressor, pump) =
                                                         he - hi
For pump only, hes - hi = vi(Pe - Pi)
Throttling Valves and Throttling Processes: No work, no heat transfer, and single-mass stream. Velocity terms are often
insignificant.
         hi = he

Boilers, Condensers, Evaporators, One Side in a Heat
Exchanger: Heat transfer terms are significant. For a single-mass stream, the following applies:
         hi + q = he

Heat Exchangers: No heat loss to the surroundings or work. Two separate flowrates mo 1 and mo 2 :
         mo 1 _h1i − h1e j = mo 2 _h 2e − h2i j

Mixers, Separators, Open or Closed Feedwater Heaters:
         Σmo ihi = Σmo ehe      and
         Σmo i = Σmo e

Basic Cycles
Heat engines take in heat QH at a high temperature TH, produce a net amount of work W, and reject heat QL at a low temperature
TL. The efficiency η of a heat engine is given by:
         η = W/QH = (QH – QL)/QH
The most efficient engine possible is the Carnot Cycle. Its efficiency is given by:
         ηc = (TH – TL)/TH
where TH and TL = absolute temperatures (Kelvin or Rankine).
The following heat-engine cycles are plotted on P-v and T-s diagrams in this section:
        Carnot, Otto, Rankine
Refrigeration cycles are the reverse of heat-engine cycles. Heat is moved from low to high temperature requiring work, W.
Cycles can be used either for refrigeration or as heat pumps.
Coefficient of Performance (COP) is defined as:
         COP = QH /W for heat pumps, and as
         COP = QL/W for refrigerators and air conditioners.
