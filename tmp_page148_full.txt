Thermodynamics


where
        Wo net = rate of net or shaft work
        mo = mass flowrate (subscripts i and e refer to inlet and exit states of system)
        g = acceleration of gravity
        Z = elevation
        V = velocity
        ms = mass of fluid within the system
        us = specific internal energy of system
        Qo in = rate of heat transfer (neglecting kinetic and potential energy of the system)
Special Cases of Open Systems (with no change in kinetic or potential energy)
Constant Volume process:
         wrev = – v (P2 – P1)
Constant System Pressure process:
         wrev = 0
Constant Temperature process: (ideal gas) Pv = constant
         wrev = RT ln (v2 /v1) = RT ln (P1 /P2)
Isentropic process (ideal gas):
         Pvk = constant
         wrev = k (P2v2 – P1v1)/(1 – k)
              = k R (T2 – T1)/(1 – k)
                                          ^ k - 1h /k
        wrev =    k RT >1 - d P2 n                      H
                 k- 1 1       P1

Polytropic process (ideal gas):
        Pvn = constant
        Closed system
        wrev = (P2v2 – P1v1)/(1 – n)
        One-inlet, one-exit control volume
        wrev = n (P2v2 – P1v1)/(1 – n)

Steady-Flow Systems
The system does not change state with time. This assumption is valid for steady operation of turbines, pumps, compressors,
throttling valves, nozzles, and heat exchangers, including boilers and condensers.
        Rmo i `hi + Vi2 /2 + gZi j − Rmo e `he + Ve2 /2 + gZe j + Qo in − Woout = 0
        and
        Rmo i = Rmo e

where
        mo = mass flowrate (subscripts i and e refer to inlet and exit states of system)
        g = acceleration of gravity
        Z = elevation
        V = velocity
        Qo in = net rate of heat transfer into the system
        Woout = net rate of work out of the system
